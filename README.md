# FDF (Wireframe Model)
This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object
in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.

FDF is particularly meaningful to me due to my background in topography. It has been an enjoyable experience that deepened my understanding of opening graphics windows, drawing within them, and gaining insights into their functioning. It has also allowed me to apply my knowledge of programs like AUTOCAD and COVADIS, which I regularly utilize for drawing geographical plans. This project has sparked my interest in graphic programming and has been immensely rewarding.

In this project, I am using the Brenham algorithm for drawing our maps in Windows using [MiniLib](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html)X
These resources made me build this topography project FDF:

Just some patience with this video is very good for understanding how Bresenham works and why u must use it:

Is good to know DDA:

[Geographic coordinate conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_conversion#From_geodetic_to_ECEF_coordinates)

Some magic with mathematic for rotation in the FDF bonus
